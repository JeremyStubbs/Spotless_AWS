This repository contains the code used to seed a dynamodb database and also the lambda function with which the API Gateway interacts to GET data from the database.

Seed.py was used to seed the dynamodb database from seedData.json.

The lambda function was written in node.

The python files perform what is suggested in their titles and are included as a bonus.
